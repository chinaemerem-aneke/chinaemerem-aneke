# 👋 Hello World, I’m Chinaemerem Aneke!

I'm not just learning to code — I'm crafting experiences, pixel by pixel.  
Frontend development has my heart 💙 and coffee keeps it beating ☕️.

---

## 🔭 What I’m Up To
Currently building cool stuff with:
- ⚛️ **React** – turning components into magic
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** – styling like a boss, utility-first!
- 🌐 **HTML, CSS & JavaScript** – the solid trio that started it all

---

## 🌱 Growing, One Line of Code at a Time
- Learning by doing. Breaking things. Fixing them. Repeating.  
- Working on real-world projects to level up daily.
- Sharing wins and lessons along the way (even the awkward bugs 🐞).

---

## 🤝 Let’s Build Together!
I love connecting with:
- Devs who are learning (like me)
- Creators who think outside the box
- People who believe in collaboration over competition

Got an idea or project in mind? Let’s talk 👇
